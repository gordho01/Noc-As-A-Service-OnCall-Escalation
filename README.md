## NOC IOG Service Topic 
## OnCall Escalation Service:

## Overview
OnCall escalation is the process by which the NOC contacts LNRSG point of contacts for various departments and/or applications outside of the normal business hours or if contact cannot be made through a standard route when an issue becomes urgent, emergent, or mission critical. Requests to contact an OnCall come into the NOC via email, Microsoft Teams, during Bridge line calls, and via the NOC hunt group.  
## Process
Calling the OnCall allows for contact to be made with appropriate personnel in a department to address immediate business needs that should be managed expeditiously because they are deemed time critical. The procedure is also put in place when to deal with times when contact with a department cannot be made during normal business hours or through the normal personnel route. It is a process that lists several contacts to make. It starts with junior members of a team and then moving up to the more senior members of a team until contact is made with a live person to address whatever issue that needs to be addressed. The escalation list/path can be found in operational readiness, the LN OnCall List in Confluence, via Pager Duty, or simply be taken via email.
## Feature Requests
One feature that would enhance the ability for NOC as a service to provide better service in this area would be to have the OnCall function for phone escalation work via Pager Duty exclusively. This would ensure that there was a system in place that automatically escalates calls to the next highest in the escalation chain as well as have a centralized system for recording when and how escalation issues were responded to and/or resolved.
## Bugs
The OnCall escalation system is not centralized. There are at least four common ways of finding an OnCall number and this could lead to a time-consuming process when reaching an OnCall is a time sensitive issue. Some ways of following the escalation path require checking Operational Readiness, or one may be able to page an OnCall person by going directly to the Pager Duty application. Having one way to page the OnCalls may help to address looking to multiple sources for phone numbers of who to call. Using the Pager Duty application as a primary source for contacting the OnCalls is one suggestion to fix this bug. The other sources could still be used as a secondary system if Pager Duty goes down.

## Indicators
 1.	Availability - The service needs to be available 24/7 365 days per week
 2. Response Time - Triage is meant to be a timely turnaround time service. NOC response to requests for contact with OnCall should happen within 3-5 minutes of         said request.  A 15-minute turnaround time for each contact to respond in the escalation process should provide many opportunities for response to issues.         Exceptions for more urgent issues should be made. If contact cannot be made for example, during normal business hours then a call to the OnCall is immediately warranted. Calls to the OnCall are urgent in nature as a contact for a department could not be made right away or one must be made after normal business hours. 
 3. Accuracy - The accuracy of the triage service is important as calls to OnCalls are to be made only for urgent, emergent, or mission critical situations. 
## Objectives
 1.	Availability - 99.9% availability 365 24/7.
 2. Response Time - 90% of all triage requests will be completed within 3-5 minutes. 
 3. Accuracy - 90% of all triaged projects complete within 20% of triage estimation.
## Agreements
 1. Availability - 99% availability 365 24/7.
 2. Response Time - 75% of all triage requests will be completed within 3- 5 minutes.
 3. Accuracy - 75% of all triaged projects complete within 25% of triage estimation.
